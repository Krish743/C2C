Sports
Sports Facilities
LDCE provides excellent sports facilities to ensure students maintain a healthy balance between academics and physical activities.
Cricket
Cricket is more of a religion to the people of India and so it is to L.D.C.E. The institute team has constantly dominated the inter-college sports meet and is a force to reckon with. The inter-year and L.D Cup tournaments are also fiercely contested and more often than not, produce new talents for the university team.
Football
With the sudden resurgence of football in our country, it has found its feet in the field of sports. Our very own Ronaldinho's and Ronaldo's slog it out daily in the well-maintained football field. Experienced coaches provide the necessary guidance for students to hone their skills.
Other Sports Facilities
Basketball
Table Tennis
Volleyball
Badminton
Chess
Carrom

Keepsake Welding Research & Skill Development Center of Excellence
About the Center
The state-of-the-art Keepsake Welding Research & Skill Development Center of Excellence has been established at L D College of Engineering, Ahmedabad as per MoU among:
Center for Entrepreneurship Development (CED), Gujarat State
Gujarat Technological University / L D College of Engineering, Ahmedabad
Keepsake Engineering Consultancy Pvt. Ltd, Ahmedabad
Casting, forming, machining, welding, and powder metallurgy are the chief manufacturing processes, where welding or joining are the most vital activities. Teaching welding technology in collaboration with an industry is a step forward in the direction of dealing with the subject in its total perspective including the theoretical and practical aspects to the required depth and width.
Mission Statement
"A Global institution for developing and enhancing knowledge of individuals and organisations with emphasis on training, research, safety and skill upgradation. Our field of focus would be specific to welding both manually and automated.
The goal is to fulfil the industrial requirements of a skilled individual starting from work force to managerial level. We would also be engaging for guiding the industry in defining and developing the process as per their requirements. In house research projects in combination with students and industry would be carried out in parallel."
Our Facilities
TIG Machines
Advanced TIG machines from LORCH Germany
KUKA Robots
8 Axis Robots from KUKA Germany for automated welding
MMA Machines
Professional MMA machines from Miller USA
Plasma PTA
